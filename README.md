# Pick and place Machine
This is a mechanical & robotic proyect to get experience, in one hand, driving different linear actuators such as stepper motors and dc servo motors, and in the other hand, with 3d mecanical cad software.



## Linear motion rail
There are several linear motion rails types. The one we are going to test here is a rectangular-miniature-linear motion rail with with re-circulating bearings. This has several advantages such as:

1. They offer very low friction forces.
2. They restrict the movement into only one axis with a very high precisi√≥n
3. In comparison with cilindrical linear motion rails, the rectangular can be longer and suffers less deformations. This is given by the cross section geometry properties.

### Manufacturers
There are several rectangular-miniature-linear motion rail/guide manufacturers such as

1. THK
2. Tomson linear (https://www.thomsonlinear.com)
3. HIWIN (www.hiwin.com)

In particular, the line mgn07h from HIWIN is available on ebay trough the vendor "motion constrained" (https://motionconstrained.com/).
